# E-Commerce Platform with Automated CI/CD Pipeline

An e-commerce platform is a software application that enables businesses to sell products or services online. It typically consists of:

1. Backend: Manages product listings, user accounts, orders, and payments.
2. Frontend: Provides a user interface for customers to browse products, add items to a cart, and complete purchases. E-commerce platforms are essential for businesses to reach a global audience, streamline operations, and provide a seamless shopping experience.

An automated CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline significantly improves the development, testing, and deployment processes for an e-commerce platform. It also ensures 

- Faster Time-to-Market: New features and updates are delivered to customers quickly.
- Improved Customer Experience: Reliable deployments and fewer bugs lead to a smoother shopping experience.
- Competitive Advantage: The ability to iterate and innovate faster than competitors.

By automating the development lifecycle, businesses can focus on growth and customer satisfaction while maintaining a robust and scalable platform.

## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>
### Introduction
This project implements a modern e-commerce platform with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline, designed to streamline development, testing, and deployment processes. The platform consists of two core components:

- Backend API: A Node.js/Express service for product management, user authentication, and order processing.
- Frontend Web Application: A React-based UI for users to interact with products, accounts, and orders.

The infrastructure leverages GitHub Actions for continuous integration/delivery, Docker for containerization, and cloud deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP) for scalability.

## Features <a name="features"></a>
**Backend (API)**: We made use of Node.js/Express as our backend for:

- Product listing management
- User authentication
- Order processing
- Unit tests with Jest

**Frontend (Webapp)**: we made use of React as our frontend for

- Product browsing
- User account management
- Order placement interface
- Responsive React UI
